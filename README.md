OpenGL game

It's a project using the library Glut and FreeGlut, developed as a academic and instructional game. Here you'll find collision treatment,
drawing of strings and also how to use the keyboard to controle the object.

First of all it's necessary to setup Visual Studio 2013 to work with opengl, I'll left a tutorial THAT WASN'T MADE BY ME but works pretty
fine and I hope that help all.
